# Land-Vitality-Web-Application
The Land Vitality Web Application is a web-based platform developed using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS, designed to manage and present land-related data in a structured and interactive way. The project follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, ensuring clean code separation and maintainability. Key features include:

Dynamic web pages for user interaction

Organized modules for data (model), logic (controller), and UI (view)

Use of JavaScript for front-end interactivity

It serves as a foundation for applications related to land monitoring, management, or environmental tracking.
